\doxysection{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{classSculptor}{Sculptor}} \\*\mbox{\hyperlink{classSculptor}{Sculptor}} class\+: The \mbox{\hyperlink{classSculptor}{Sculptor}} class creates a dynamically allocated structure and provides methods for manipulating the pixels of a 3d array }{\pageref{classSculptor}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{structVoxel}{Voxel}} \\*\mbox{\hyperlink{structVoxel}{Voxel}} struct\+: Voxels (volume elements), equivalent to the pixels of digital images, but in 3 dimensions. In Voxels it is possible to store information such as color and color opacity, necessary to idealize the elements of a sculpture }{\pageref{structVoxel}}{}
